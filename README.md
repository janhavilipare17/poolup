# PoolUp 

> Pool money. Unlock together.

A decentralized group savings dApp built on Stellar blockchain using Soroban smart contracts. Create shared savings goals, lock XLM contributions on-chain, and automatically release funds when the target is hit — no trust needed.

##  What is PoolUp?

PoolUp solves a real problem — when a group of friends wants to pool money for a trip, gift, or event, someone always has to be trusted with the funds. PoolUp eliminates this trust problem by locking funds in a Soroban smart contract that automatically releases when the goal is reached, or refunds everyone if the deadline passes.

### Real-world use cases
-  Group trips (Goa trip, Europe vacation)
-  Birthday gifts for friends
-  Event planning (parties, concerts)
-  Group orders and purchases
-  Fitness challenges with stakes

##  Features

- **Create Goals** — Set a name, target XLM amount, deadline, and emoji
- **Share Links** — Every goal gets a unique shareable link
- **Lock Funds** — Contributors lock XLM directly into the smart contract
- **Auto Release** — Funds release when target is reached
- **Auto Refund** — Everyone gets refunded if deadline passes without reaching goal
- **Real-time Updates** — Goal page polls blockchain every 5 seconds
- **Wallet Identity** — Your Stellar wallet is your identity — no signup needed
- **Dashboard** — See all goals you created or contributed to
- **Explorer Links** — Every transaction visible on Stellar Expert
